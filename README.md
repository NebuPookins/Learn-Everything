Learn-Everything: A collaborative wiki for learning all human knowledge

#How is it different from Wikipedia?

* Wikipedia's articles are written to be a reference, not as a pedagogical guide.
* Every article on Learn-Everything will start with a list of pre-requisites. E.g. the article of multiplication will state that you should know addition; the article on addition will state that you should know how to count; etc.
* The pedagogical content/material need not be contained in the Learn-Everything article itself; it's perfectly acceptable for an article to just be a link to some external source (e.g. to Wikipedia).
* Wikipedia's wiki syntax is terrible. Learn-Everything will use Markdown instead.

#Is it ready for the public?

NO! There is little more than this readme for now.

# What's the licensing like?

Undecided, but will be open source. E.g. if we use Sencha ExtJS for the UI, it'll probably end up being GPL3.
